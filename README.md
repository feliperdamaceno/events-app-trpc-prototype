# events-app-trpc-prototype

Full-Stack prototype application created to explore and test the capabilities of tRPC for efficient type-safe communication between frontend and backend.

The backend leverages Fastify and tRPC to establish a lightweight, scalable API layer, while the frontend uses React with Zustand for state management and tRPC for seamless data fetching.
