## events-app-trpc-prototype

The backend leverages Fastify and tRPC to establish a lightweight, scalable API layer, while the frontend uses React with Zustand for state management and tRPC for seamless data fetching.

### Running the Application

To get the prototype running, follow these steps:

1. #### Install Dependencies

   In both the server and client directories, run:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. #### Start the Server

   Navigate to the server directory and start the server with:

   ```bash
   npm run start
   ```

   This will launch the Fastify server, setting up the backend API with tRPC.

3. #### Build and Preview the Client

   In a separate terminal, navigate to the client directory and run:

   ```bash
   npm run build
   npm run preview
   ```

   This will build the React frontend for production and then serve it in preview mode.

The application should be accessible, with the frontend interacting with the backend via tRPC.
